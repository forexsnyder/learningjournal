# 1.	What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

	I was able to follow the logic of Ghidra.  C is not that different than Python and Ruby. I think I 
	I would spend more time with PEStudio and look at the indicators, etc.  Look up the DLL’s	and such. 
  The author of the reading assignment had way more insight about malware indicators.
  
# 2.	What did I learn today?

	I learned about Python having an API Library.  I learned about indicators of compromise 
  and software that can break down a PE file.  I learned about a watered-down NSA tool to
  reverse engineer software.
  
# 3.	What should I do differently next time?

	Read the assigned reading before the labs.
  
# 4.	What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

	Just need more exposure to the technologies.
  
# 1.	Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?

  The lab is complete but I didn’t do the Python.
