What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Doing both the lab and the ops challenge were more straight forward than most todays.  I was able to get
Splunk and Server2019 talking quickly.  I need to remember to use the custom configuration in the Windows
installation rather than default settings.  Python has different logging levels.  Looks like systemd is
different than just logging return values.  


What should I do differently next time?

Nothing much.  Today was straight forward.  I also like that I took notes on github during the lecture to help me
remember what I learned today.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

The next thing would be to take this to the cloud.  To integrate Splunk in with Snort and start

creating real time alerts.
