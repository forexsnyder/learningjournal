     I have a system for learning new skillsets.  
     First, I will feel like I am drinking from a firehose.  There will be a lot of new vocabulary words and concepts.  
     Through consistent exposure the skillset will begin to take shape and become useable.  
     When I was learning to speak Spanish, I felt this way.  I just went through a coding bootcamp and repeated the same process.  
     My plan to learn this new skillset is to absorb and research as much as possible.  
     Retention is nice, but I may not be able to connect all the pieces together until I have more experience.  I will evaluate my learning process by my ability to articulate the concepts I have learned.  
     If I can use bullet points and then talk intelligently and explain a concept to my grandma, I will feel I have mastered the concept. 
     I want to measure my ability to write reports.  I am looking for a Cloud Security Engineer role.  I plan on retesting for CISSP.  I will be a policy pusher and assessing risk.  My main task will be writing reports instead of being a technician.
     I think I will evaluate my writing abilities on a two-week rotation.
     I think that is enough time to learn new skills and see progress.   I will need to standardize my reporting skills so my progress can be measured.
