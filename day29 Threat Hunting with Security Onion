**What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?**

I really liked working in Security Onion and examining the sample data.  I would 

like to let wireshark run on my network and export the pcap file and run some of the same tests.

Leanring about longest connections and beacons was interesting.  I don't know what "normal" on my

network looks like.  It would be nice to learn what indicators we should be looking out for.

**What did I learn today?**

I learned about threat hunting and the tools Security Onion provides.  I can use Security Onion to

go through pcap data and analyze it for C&C.

Threat Hunting

Hypothesis approach

Work from the inside-> out

Assume someone is in the wire.

Beacons with many connections are strobes.



**What should I do differently next time?**

Take more notes in the lab.

**What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?**

I would like to know more about the indicators of compromise.  I imagine if I was doing

this in a enterprise enviroment, I would have more time to look up IP Addreses and look

at anything that concerned me. Go to the computer I suspected and dig deeper.
