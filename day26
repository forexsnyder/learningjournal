# What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Configuring Splunk is a perishable skill.  There are a lot of tools it has at it's disposal and I think

if I do not work with it reguarly I would forget how to add a new file.  How to search for specific output, etc.

# What did I learn today?  

I leanred how to configure Splunk and how to implement logging in Python.  Splunk offers a way to sort

through large amounts of data and group

events together.  Python logging allows me to save logging to another file.  

# What should I do differently next time?

Take more notes.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Still a little fuzzy on Python messages, I can have it log a preprogrammed message.  I would like to know what tags have it

log the native error messages.
