What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
The labs were pretty straight forward, they were mostly about finding ghost images on the hard drives.
I don't think I would forget anything the lab was simple.

What did I learn today?
Autopsy is a nice software to easily recover deleted files and see what happened on a hard drive or file.

What should I do differently next time?
Nothing it.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
It would be nice to take it a step further and see what type of files can really be reassemble.  Can a jpeg
in it's binary form be reassembled?  It seems we only looked at deleted jpegs.

Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
Assignment is completed.
